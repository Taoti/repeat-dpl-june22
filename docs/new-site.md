# CREATE A NEW TAOTI DRUPAL 8 COMPOSER BASED SITE
Note that creating a new site has more [requirements](requirements-new-site.md) than developing an existing site.

## Initialize Local Site Repository
- Clone the [base repository](https://github.com/Taoti/drupal8) to your computer to a new folder. Use the clone command
to place your new site in a folder to match the name you're about to use for \[NEW-MACHINE-SITE-NAME\] below.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Taoti/drupal8.git my-new-site
```

- Remove the git origin remote, this is important to do because the next command we run is going to establish the git
remote and do everything else for us. 
```bash
git remote remove origin
```

## Initializing Your New Site

- Run the following command to get everything started with GitHub, CircleCI and Pantheon:
Please note that "!" (exclamation points) don't work in the `--admin-password field`. `[NEW-SITE-MACHINE-NAME]` must be 
lower case, hyphenated and cannot contain symbols.
```bash
terminus build:project:create --pantheon-site="District 9" --team="Taoti Creative" --org="Taoti" --admin-email="taotiadmin@taoti.com" --admin-password="Taoti1996" --ci=circleci --git=github ./ NEW-SITE-MACHINE-NAME --preserve-local-repository
```

> Note: if you get a drush permissions error while that is attempting to run, you likely need [drush permissions patch](
https://github.com/NickWilde1990/terminus-build-tools-plugin/commit/1ed3bfc4d52bc0eafc6b93da8b9cbb4308e28eca). If so,
run:
```bash
cd ~/.terminus/plugins/terminus-build-tools-plugin
curl https://github.com/NickWilde1990/terminus-build-tools-plugin/commit/1ed3bfc4d52bc0eafc6b93da8b9cbb4308e28eca.patch > permissions.patch
git apply permissions.patch
```

## Post Creation steps

- Edit `.lando.yml` and change the site name to your new site name, and update config values to match your new site's
pantheon instance.

- Update the title of the `README.md` to show that this is a specific site, not the base code.
  
- Initialize your local Lando instance for this site - for more details see the [primary readme](../README.md) - but use
the local database in `db/drupal8.sql.gz` and push that to Pantheon as it has some config changes etc that we want to
use rather than the default Pantheon installed database. 

```bash
lando start
lando db-import db/drupal8.sql.gz
lando drush updb -y
lando drush cex -y
git add -A
git commit -m "updated config"
lando push --files=none --code=none --database=dev
git push --set-upstream origin master
```

- Make the repository private:
    - go to your new repository (which will have an url like `https://github.com/Taoti/NEW-SITE-MACHINE-NAME`).
    - Click the `settings` tab near the top.
    - Scroll alllll the way down, and click `Make Private` in the Danger Zone and follow prompts.
