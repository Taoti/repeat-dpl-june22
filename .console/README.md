Use these tools to generate multiple content type configuration to a new module 
with Drupal Console. Replace "custom_node" strings in `console.chain.yml` to 
suit your project, and add as many bundles as needed. Usage:

    # Replace custom_node with your destination module's machine name.
    ./console.generate.sh custom_node
